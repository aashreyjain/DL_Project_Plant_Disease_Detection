# DL_Project_Plant_Disease_Detection

Plants are essential to global food security, yet plant diseases can cause 
significant crop losses. Manual monitoring for disease detection is labour
intensive and cause errors, which can hinder timely intervention. This project 
aims to develop an automated system using computer vision and AI to detect 
plant diseases early, improving crop health and yield. We propose a context 
aware 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the approach for 
classifying plant diseases based on leaf images, leveraging the widely used 
PlantVillage dataset.
Agriculture, a cornerstone of economies worldwide, relies on healthy crop yields. 
However, factors such as microbial infections and pests can severely impact 
crops, leading to yield losses and economic strain. Some of the low GDP 
countries where most of their population is fully dependent on agriculture for 
their livelihoods, disease prevention is crucial. AI and Deep Learning techniques 
provide a promising approach for automated plant disease identification, 
offering farmers faster, more accurate diagnoses without manual intervention. 
This research aims to focus on a CNN-based framework for plant disease 
detection and survival estimation, aimed at enhancing yield quality and 
productivity by early and accurate disease detection.
